## Installing Dependencies <a name="Introduction"></a>
1. In order to run this program without errors, all the necessary libraries must be installed as outlined per [Requirements.txt](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/Requirements.txt) file. For the easiest installation process: 
   - Open this project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and open the terminal by pressing 
``
Ctrl+Shift+`
``.
   - Then, install the dependecies with pip and the terminal using:
  
     ```
     pip3 install -r Requirements.txt
     ```
<br>

## Running the Project
1. Once all dependencies have been installed, you are ready to run the project.
    - **Using VS Code:** Navigate to the project's [RunMe.py]([##RunMe.py](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/RunMe.py)) file, and run the file. 
        
        **NOTE:** There will be a 5 to 10 minute delay after you type your stock in the first window in order to train and test the algorithms.
        <br>

        ### First Pop-Up Window
        - Contains entry box for user to input stock. Once typed, and enter is selected, algorithms will begin computing.

          <br>

        ### Second Pop-Up Window
        - Here, you can select which algorithm you would like to see the prediction for.
        
            **Dark Mode**

          <br>

        ### Algorithmic Predictions Windows
        - Lastly, you can now access all the information relevant to the learner you selected.

## Other Functionalities
### Implementing BUY/SELL Buttons
1. The user interface has two buttons after selecting the learner: BUY and SELL. Currently, this project as is does not incorporate BUY and SELL of the stock you inputted in the fist pop-up window.

    - If you **do not** wish to use the BUY and SELL buttons functionality, ignore this section and [run the project](#running-the-project)! Otherwise, follow these instructions:
    
        **Step One:** Install [Trader WorkStation (TWS) API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php#tws-software).
        
        **Step Two:** Create an [InteractiveBrokers account](https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/Application) and ensure a funded account.

        **Step Three:** Un-comment out lines [562-564](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py#L562-L564), [568-570](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py#L568-L570), [951-953](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py#L951-L953), and [957-959](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py#L951-L953) of [UserInterface.py](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py).

        **Step Four:** Follow short instructions on `Connecting Code to TWS` section of the [Software Documentation.docx](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/Software%20Documentation.docx) to ensure an established Interactive Brokers connection.

        **Step Five:** [Run the project](#running-the-project)!

### More Predictions Button
1. Once the second window pops up and you select a learner, there is a `More Predictions` button on the bottom right.
    - The `More Predictions` button brings another window to pop up with a plot of approximately the last 30 days of predictions. 
      - The green bar represents an `ACCURATE` prediction, meaning the following day there was a positive portfolio return based on the prediciton. 
      - A red bar represents the opposite, `INACCURATE`. 
    - The x-axis shows integers with a negative sign preceding it. `-1` means yesterday, `-4` means 4 days ago, `-20` means 20 days ago, etc.

## Repository File Explanations
1. This section provides a very general description and overall purpose of every single file present in this project. For a more intense, deeper technical understanding of the files, refer to the [Software Documentation.docx](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/Software%20Documentation.docx) that provides more in-depth descriptions of all code in this project.


   ### Data/Istanbul.csv
   - **Description:** This dataset includes the returns of multiple worldwide indexes for a number of days in history. 
   - **Purpose:** Utilized in [TestLearners.ipynb](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/TestLearners.ipynb) to assess our learners per the ML4T [university course project by Tucker Balch](https://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Spring_2020_Project_3:_Assess_Learners).
     - The overall objective is to predict what the return for the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index will be on the basis of the other index returns. Y in this case is the last column to the right, and the X values are the remaining columns to the left (except the first column which is the date).

   ### Images/{ImageName}.png
   - **Description:** This is a folder that simply contains the images for our `README.md` and [UserInterface.py](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/UserInterface.py) files.

   ### Learners.py
   - **Description:** Contains all of our algorithms including a `decision tree`, `random tree`, `bootstrap aggregating learner`, `insane learner`, `Dyna-Q`, `Strategy Dyna-Q`, and `Deep-Q`.

   ### Output.py
   - **Description:** Ties in together all of our utility functions and algorithms together into one clean output.

   - **Purpose:** Facilitate the user's experience when using this repository.

   ### Requirements.txt

   - **Purpose:** To technically document all functions in a manner that it will be easy to incorporate/understand the code in the future.

   ### TestLearners.ipynb
   - **Description:** Tests the performance of all our learners in the [Learners.py](https://github.com/dannyleall/StockMarketTraderBot/blob/main/Learners.py).

   ### UtilitiesTestAndExamples.py
   - **Description:** Contains all testing for the utility functions' functionality. Also contains all of the examples in the form of a function respective to `lessons 7 through 10`. 
   - **Purpose:** Ensure utility functions work as expected and grasp a better understanding of the `ML4T Udacity Coursework`.
